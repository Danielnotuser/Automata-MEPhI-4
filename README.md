lab1 - Regular expressions processing with State Machine Compiler, Flex and c++ std::regex
lab2 - Construction of a syntax tree for a regular expression, a non-deterministic finite automaton, a deterministic finite automaton. Subsequent minimization of DFA, intersection and inversion of languages, construction of a K-path.
lab3 - Development of my own programming language, using flex as a scanner and bison as a parser. Subsequent development of the robot's exit from the labyrinth, written in my programming language.
